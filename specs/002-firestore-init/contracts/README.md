# API Contracts

This feature does not expose any REST API endpoints.

The initialization script interacts directly with:
- **Firestore Emulator** (localhost:8080) via Firebase Admin SDK
- **GameState Document** (gameState/live) - see data-model.md for schema

No API contracts are generated for this feature.
